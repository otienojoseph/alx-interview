# 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix

### Concepts Needed:

    Matrix Representation in Python:
        Understanding how 2D matrices are represented using lists of lists in Python.
        Accessing and modifying elements in a 2D matrix.

    In-place Operations:
        Performing operations on data without creating a copy of the data structure.
        The importance of minimizing space complexity by modifying the matrix in place.

    Matrix Transposition:
        Understanding the concept of transposing a matrix (swapping rows and columns).
        Implementing matrix transposition as a step in the rotation process.

    Reversing Rows in a Matrix:
        Manipulating rows of a matrix by reversing their order as part of the rotation process.

    Nested Loops:
        Using nested loops to iterate through 2D data structures like matrices.
        Modifying elements within nested loops to achieve the desired rotation.

### Tasks
**0. Rotate 2D Matrix**

Given an n x n 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.

    - Prototype: def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):
    - Do not return anything. The matrix must be edited in-place.
    - You can assume the matrix will have 2 dimensions and will not be empty.
